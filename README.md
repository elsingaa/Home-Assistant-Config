# Live in Comfort
I tried Home Assitant a couple of years ago, put it aside again, because then it wasn't there where I needed it to be.
Recently I reinstalled Home Assistant to integrate all the various systems I use for controlling our home.

In an effort to document my configuration I created this repository.
